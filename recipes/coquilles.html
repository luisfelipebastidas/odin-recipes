    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Coquilles Saint-Jacques is one of the world's most delicious dishes. It's rich and decadent, and yet still light. For something fancy, this is pretty easy to make!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup diced shallots</li>
        <li>½ pound white button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 pound sea scallops</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 large oven-safe scallop shells</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
        <li>8 fresh tarragon leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add shallots and sauté until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, salt, and black pepper; increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Gently place scallops into wine and poach in the mushroom mixture until barely firm, about 2 minutes per side; transfer scallops to a bowl. Strain mushroom mixture into another bowl, reserving mushrooms and cooking liquid separately.</li>
        <li>Return strained liquid to skillet, pour in any accumulated juices from scallops, and stir in cream. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring often, until cream sauce is reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and let mixture cool for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Quickly whisk egg yolk into cream sauce until combined. Transfer skillet to a work surface (such as a heatproof countertop or cutting board) and stir 2 in teaspoons tarragon, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Divide mushroom mixture into scallop shells, spreading it out to cover the bottoms of shells; place about 3 scallops onto each portion. Spoon cream sauce over scallops to coat; let sauce drizzle down into mushrooms. Sprinkle lightly with Gruyère cheese and paprika.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. Slightly crinkle a large sheet of aluminum foil and place onto a baking sheet. Place filled shells onto foil and press lightly to help them stay level.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving plates lined with napkins to prevent shells from tipping; garnish each portion with 2 crossed tarragon leaves.``</li>
    </ol>
